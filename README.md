# Neural Network Calorie Tracker and Meal Suggester (Backend: Python, Frontend: React.js)

This project implements a full-stack web application that helps users track their calorie goals and receive personalized meal suggestions. The backend is built using Python and leverages the power of neural networks and machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn. The frontend is developed with React.js, providing a dynamic and user-friendly experience.

## Overview

This system aims to empower users to achieve their dietary goals by providing two key functionalities accessible through a web browser:

1.  **Calorie Goal Tracking:** Users can set daily calorie targets and log their meals through the React frontend, with data stored and managed by the Python backend.
2.  **Intelligent Meal Suggestions:** Based on the user's calorie goals, dietary preferences (planned feature), and potentially past eating habits, the Python backend utilizes a neural network to suggest suitable meals. These suggestions are then displayed on the React frontend.

The meal suggestion component leverages machine learning to learn patterns in food data and user preferences, offering more relevant and personalized recommendations over time. The separation of concerns between the React frontend for user interaction and the Python backend for data processing and AI logic allows for a scalable and maintainable application.

## Features

* **React.js Frontend:**
    * User-friendly interface for setting calorie goals.
    * Intuitive form for logging meals with calorie information.
    * Clear display of daily calorie intake against the set goal.
    * Presentation of meal suggestions generated by the backend.
    * Responsive design for accessibility across different devices.
* **Python Backend :**
    * API endpoints for handling user authentication (planned), goal setting, meal logging, and requesting meal suggestions.
    * Logic for storing and retrieving user data (goals, meal logs, preferences) using a database.
    * **Neural Network-Powered Meal Suggestions (TensorFlow/Keras):**
        * Utilizes a neural network trained on a dataset of meals and their nutritional information.
        * Receives user calorie budget and preferences from the frontend.
        * Suggests meals that align with the user's remaining calorie budget for the day.
        * **Future Enhancements:** Incorporate user dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, allergies, etc.) and preferences into the suggestions.
* **Data Persistence:** A database to store user data, calorie goals, meal logs, and potentially pre-processed meal data for the neural network.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    * **HTML:** For structuring the web pages.
    * **CSS:** For styling the application.
    * **JavaScript:** The primary language for frontend logic.
    * **State Management**
    * **HTTP Client **
* **Backend:**
    * **Python:** The primary programming language.
    * **Flask:** Web frameworks for building the API.
    * **TensorFlow:** An open-source machine learning framework for building and training the neural network.
    * **Keras:** A high-level API for building and training neural networks, running on top of TensorFlow.
    * **scikit-learn:** A machine learning library used for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and potentially building baseline models.
    * **NumPy:** A library for numerical computing, essential for handling data in machine learning.
    * **Pandas:** A library for data manipulation and analysis, useful for working with meal datasets.
    * **Database Connector**
* **Other:**
    * **npm** or **yarn:** Package managers for the React frontend.
    * **pip:** Package manager for the Python backend.

## Architecture

The system follows a typical client-server architecture:

1.  **Frontend (React.js):** Runs in the user's web browser, handles user interaction, and communicates with the backend via API calls.
2.  **Backend (Python/flask):** Runs on a server, receives requests from the frontend, processes data (including running the neural network for meal suggestions), and interacts with the database.
3.  **Database:** Stores persistent application data.



## Usage

1.  Ensure both the backend Python server and the React.js frontend are running.
2.  Open your web browser and navigate to the address where the React frontend is served .
3.  Create an account or log in (if authentication is implemented).
4.  Set your daily calorie goal.
5.  Log your meals throughout the day using the provided form.
6.  View your current calorie intake and remaining budget.
7.  Request meal suggestions, and the system will display personalized recommendations based on your goal and the neural network's predictions.

## Neural Network Architecture (Conceptual)

The neural network in the Python backend for meal suggestion might have an architecture like:

* **Input Layer:** Representing user's current calorie deficit, potentially time of day, and (in the future) dietary preferences encoded as numerical features.
* **Hidden Layers:** One or more layers to learn complex relationships between the input features and the output.
* **Output Layer:** Predicting a distribution over possible meals, potentially ranked by their suitability based on the remaining calorie budget.

The network would be trained on a dataset of meals with their calorie counts and potentially other nutritional information.

## Data Requirements

To train the meal suggestion neural network, a comprehensive dataset of meals with the following information is needed:

* Meal Name
* Calorie Count
* **(Optional but beneficial):** Macronutrient information (protein, carbohydrates, fats), ingredients, dietary tags (vegetarian, vegan, etc.).

The quality and size of the dataset will significantly impact the performance of the meal suggestion system.



## Ethical Considerations

* **Data Privacy:** Ensure user data is handled securely and with respect for user privacy. Implement appropriate data storage and security measures.
* **Accuracy of Information:** Strive for accuracy in the calorie information associated with meals. Regularly update and verify the underlying food data.
* **Health Advice Disclaimer:** This system should not be considered a substitute for professional dietary advice. Include a clear disclaimer advising users to consult with a nutritionist or healthcare professional for personalized guidance.
